# Hotel-Check-in-Application
This is a hotel check-in application build on Android Studio .
With the help of this application tourists can easily make bookings and remotely check in their hotel rooms without any hassle at the reception.
I have used JAVA in the design of the frontend as well as writing the logic of the backend of the application.
The application has a login and registration activity so a new user has to register himself/herself with his name,email and password which will be checked in the database of firebase.
If the user has already registered he directly goes to login and enters with his email and password proceeding to the booking activity where he has to enter the details of his/her stay and then finally booking to get the confirmation.
